Analyzing Climate Change Using Earth Surface Temperature DataSet
Topic- analyzing climate change using earth surface temperature data set.

 

Project outline- the project shall aim to analyze trends in climate change with the help of time series analysis over the period of 265 yrs (1750 -recent)

 

Inspiration- As time goes on, we should all be concerned about the threat that climate change poses. Abruptly changing weather and releasing greenhouse gases, both of which are a huge contributing factor to global warming. The main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions are methane and carbon dioxide emissions. The sources include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial waste. In recent years, the Earth's surface temperature has increased dramatically, and heat waves have increased in frequency. Concurrently, glaciers are melting, reducing the size of the land. Not just mankind, but the entire animal kingdom is negatively affected.

Scientists believe that mother Earth will continue to be destroyed if something is not done as soon as feasible. Every major corporation is now collaborating to make choices that will mitigate the effects of climate change on future generations. WHO and NASA have enacted a number of regulations for all the nations included in this climate change index.

 

The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study contains 1.6 billion temperature records. 
It is very well packaged and has interesting subsets (like countries, cities, etc.). 
They have published the source data for the transformations. 
They have included methods that have weather observations from a short timespan to be included. 
In this dataset, there are several files. Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures record from 1750 – recent.
The raw data collected from Berkley Earth has been processed and cleaned by many developers and made into a proper dataset; thereby, researchers can work upon and bring more insights. 

Dataset Used – Link.

 

The four main components of the study are:

Trend
Seasonality
Cyclicity
Irregularity
